    "## What is Regular Expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with text is HARD. Do we consider \"dog\" to be different from \"dogs\"? How do we explain to a computer if we want those words to be considered the same word? In written language, most rules are not really rules, but patterns within text. Regular expression is a paradigm for describing patterns in text in order to accomodate the flexibility of written language and our attempts to find information within larger bodies of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I might want to find a series of keywords within a body of text in order to determine whether or not the topic of the text has been correctly identified (or even in order to determine what the topic of the text actually is!). Regular expression has the ability to help express patterns in text that we may want to examine, and the flexibility to determine exactly how we want to capture it. Some common uses of regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validating emails, phone numbers, addresses, and other text blocks\n",
    "- Finding subsets of a document\n",
    "- Determining the presence or count of particular words, phrases or patterns\n",
    "- Web Scraping\n",
    "- Grammar suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course many more ways to use regular expression. Let's start looking at how we can use it in our personal data analysis.\n"

    "Now that we have our text imported, we can begin to explore it. We will start by looking for the word \"Elizabeth\" (she is the main character of the novel, and is also sometimes called \"Lizzy\" or \"Eliza\"). In order to look for the word \"Elizabeth\", we will use the `re.search` function mentioned earlier. This function takes two arguments: a regular expression (or pattern), and a string in which to search for matches to that pattern. Regular expression patterns will be stored as strings, but we will use **raw strings**. To create a raw string, we prepend the string with a single letter `r`, so that our string looks something like this: `r''`. \n",

When we include a string like `r'Elizabeth'` as our pattern, we are telling regular expression to find a **capital** \"E\", followed by lower case \"l\", followed by lower case \"i\", followed by lower case \"z\", followed by lower case \"a\", followed by lower case \"b\", followed by lower case \"e\", followed by lower case \"t\", followed by lower case \"h\".

    "What did we just do? A couple things. First, we used the `re.finditer` function, which generates an **iterable** object. In order to get back all of our results, we need to create a list by iterating over the results that are generated by our iterable object. We used a list comprehension to do that. (Remember that list comprehensions are statements like `[i for i in some_iterable]`). At that point, we had a list of results. We then checked the length of the list for each of two different regular expressions. One for just Elizabeth, and one for Eliza/Elizabeth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's break down the difference in the regular expressions. There are two differences between our first and second expressions. First, we used `()` to encapsulate a portion of the word Elizabeth that may not be present in some cases. Parens (`()`) create **groups** in regular expression. Sometimes we will want to capture groups from within an expression, and other times we will only want to indicate that a group may or may not be present. In this case, we indicate that the sequence `beth` is not strictly required for a match by using a `?` character after the group. This doesn't mean that our text needs to include a `?`. The `?` symbol says \"I want either 1 or 0 matches to the \"beth\" sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, \"beth\" may be present (have one match) or not present (have zero matches) while still allowing us to have a successful match to our regular expression pattern. There are several similar expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | :---: |\n",
    "| `?` | 1 or 0 repetitions|\n",
    "| `+` | 1 or more repetitions | \n",
    "| `*` | 0 or more repetitions |\n",
    "|`{n}` | exactly `n` repetitions|\n",
    "|`{m,n}` | between `m` and `n` repetitions|\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these expressions with groups, or with single characters. What if we wanted to find the end of sentences in our text? Let's try and express that:"
